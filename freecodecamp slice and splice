//Basic Algorithm Scripting: Slice and Splice

//You are given two arrays and an index.

//Use the array methods slice and splice to copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.

//Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.

//Return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.

//Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Write your own code.



function frankenSplice(arr1, arr2, n) {
  // It's alive. It's alive!
  let arr2copy = arr2.slice();

  for (let i=0;i<arr1.length;i++) {
    arr2copy.splice(n, 0, arr1[i]);
    n++;
  }

  return arr2copy;
}
